# KnockKnock-Game

This two-player game models the GoStop Impulsivity Paradigm (http://www.nrlc-group.net/software/GoStop.php), well known in Cognitive Psychology. Two pieces of plywood with a piezo glued underneath are wired to a set of flashing RGB LED's, which are in turn mounted on top of a wooden box. The players are asked to knock on their piece of plywood every time the lights flash green. The player who knocks first gets a point. However, if either player knocks for a Red LED, they lose two points. The first player to reach 16 points wins. Points are displayed on two LED strips mounted to the side of the wood tissue box.
